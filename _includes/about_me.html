                    I am a software engineer with experience in multiple industries, and currently a graduate student at University of California, Riverside. I have been exclusively working to develop new products at startups and large organisations. I have enjoyed exploring entire product development cycle, and learnt to follow Agile methodology. There is no clear winner in terms of suitable tech stack in such a culture and I love to be flexible and learn a different approach, when an opportunity arises. To remain effective in the midst of ever-changing languages, the one thing I leave unchanged is following good coding practices applicable to the paradigm and following test driven development, irrespective.

                    <li>
                        <b>Learning</b>. My current interest is in big data and distributed computing. Besides my academic exposure in Spark and other Apache platforms I am learning other distributed applications like containerization (kubernetes). Re-learning Go for making any contributions has been exciting. I am also learning minor deep learning projects through a few courses.

                        <b>Reading</b>. When I am not programming (or binge watching anime), I am engrossed in an old book. I love to read classical fiction (I am re-reading Anna Karenina). I have also been reading a few biographies lately.
